Support Page
============

GovReady-Q comes with a default Support page at ``/support``.

After installing GovReady-Q, you can configure the Support page content
via GovReady-Q's Django admin interface, .e.g, `http://localhost:8000/admin/siteapp/support/ <http://localhost:8000/admin/siteapp/support/>`__. GovReady-Q will only use the content in the first "Support" record.
