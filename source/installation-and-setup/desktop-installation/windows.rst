GovReady-Q is designed to be installed on Unix-like operating systems.

There are two ways to run GovReady-Q on Windows.

To try GovReady-Q, or to run it without modifications, we recommend using a container solution.  See :ref:`Container-based Installation`.

For a deeper trial of GovReady-Q, or to install it for development (making changes to the source code), you should set up a Unix-like environment on your Windows computer, and then refer to :ref:`Server-based Installation`.
