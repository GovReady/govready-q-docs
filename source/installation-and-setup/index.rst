This document will guide you through the GovReady-Q installation process.

Setting up GovReady-Q involves installing the GovReady-Q server, a database, a WSGI server to run the Python code, and optionally connecting GovReady-Q to a mailserver to send invitations and notifications.

To try GovReady-Q on your personal computer, try "Desktop Installation".  Easy defaults make it quick to try.

"Container-based Installation" will guide you through setting up GovReady-Q with pre-built containers, which can either be run locally on a personal computer, or in the cloud in a container orchestration system.

To install on a Linux-based server, refer to "Server-based Installation".
