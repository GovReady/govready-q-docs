Why GovReady-Q?
---------------

.. raw:: html

   <!-- Compliance is a huge value-add for organizations because it scales trust. "Certified" means tested and approved. When pace and scale of an activity reaches a certain critical point, increases, quality assurance by individuals must be replaced with compliance regimes on risk/reward themselves risk assessment with compliance regimes... 

   For too many organizations, compliance has become the main bottleneck---the primary constraint---on the pace of innovation. Their staff experiences assessments, documentation, and audits as exasperating, invisible work holding back their ability to deliver new value.
   -->

Everything about developing and deploying software is
accelerating…except for compliance. Why? Because:

-  maintaining written documentation is too slow,
-  pondering how jargon-laden control guidance applies is too hard,
-  there’s little reuse, and no compliance documentation supply chain.

To stop needing months to authorize systems that deploy in minutes,
assessments and authorizations need to be assembled from vetted,
pre-fabricated components sourced from the same software supply chain
with which we assemble applications.

How GovReady-Q Accelerates Compliance
-------------------------------------

GovReady accelerates compliance through component-centric guidance,
pre-written documentation, and collaboration.

**When you use or install GovReady-Q, you gain access to a marketplace
of small, self-service compliance apps written by peers and vendors that
map system components to security controls and guide you step-by-step
through assessments and documentation.**

   Apps map components to security/compliance controls

As you and your teammates collaboratively answer questions, the
compliance apps work with GovReady-Q to store your data in a relational
database and automagically generate and maintain your compliance
artifacts for auditors.

GovReady-Q’s contribution to Compliance-as-Code is the data abstractions
for shareable, reusable, and customizable packages—*Compliance Apps*—to
map the relationship between a system component and a set of controls.
The approach is innovative, yet familiar. Compliance Apps:

-  enable a hub/marketplace for community contributions;
-  extend inherited controls model to each system component;
-  enable modern, user-friendly experiences;
-  support agile, iterative workflows.

.. ATTENTION:: GovReady-Q software is “Beta” software best suited for
   early adopters needing faster compliance for DevSecOps.

   <!-- GovReady-Q accelerates compliance by tackling the data management challenges of compliance. GovReady-Q does not scan servers or end-points. (Lots of tools do that.) Instead, GovReady-Q makes it easy to trace the relationship between system components and security control descriptions and evidence. 

   GovReady-Q is open source GRC (Governance Risk & Compliance) platform for self-service preparation of compliance artifacts. It's ultra-friendly to use and ultra-compatible with Agile/DevOps Software Development Life Cycle.

GovReady-Q Philosophy
---------------------

**Compliance is not security. Compliance scales security.**

Compliance is a technique humans have developed for enabling trust in
systems that are too large and complex for individuals to assess
trustworthiness. Compliance scales participation, attestation and
verification of recommended practices.

-  We love security and innovation and believe they enable each other.
-  We believe security and compliance are standard, not premium add-ons.
-  We view compliance as a by-product of a well-instrumented process.
-  We value ease-of-use to increase adoption.
-  We value automation to increase consistency.
-  We see virtualization and DevOps enabling massive gains in security
   and compliance.
