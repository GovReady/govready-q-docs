App Sources
=============

Creating an App - ADVANCED
-----------------------------

GovReady allows organizations to create original apps for their own projects. Examples of premade apps can be found on GovReady's GitHub `here
<https://github.com/GovReady/Lightweight_ATO_template/tree/master/apps/light-ato-apps>`_.

Disclaimer: GovReady app creation is a more advanced procedure that is not recommended for inexperienced users.

For app creation, the app.yaml file is the "table of contents" for the app. Create an app.yaml file by creating a YAML file mirroring the example in the video below or by copying and editing an existing YAML file from the above GitHub link. 

Once an app.yaml is created, the user can create module files to replicate processes and create questionnaires for the system.

See Video Demonstration, `Here
<https://vimeo.com/418917112>`_.

For more emergent app design, it is possible to hide and reveal apps and questionnaires based on conditional statements. 

See Video Demonstration, `Here
<https://vimeo.com/418917770>`_.



Adding an App Source
-----------------------------

To add an app source to a running version of GovReady, navigate to the application's admin page. This will vary depending on your organization's deployed instance of GovReady. On the admin page, navigate to "App Sources". If you are adding a new app source, name the new app source in the "slug" section and select the path of the app source. GovReady supports local paths as well as paths from GitHub. Save the app source by clicking "Save" at the bottom of the page. Next, click on your newly added app source. In the "Compliance App" section at the bottom of the screen, select the version number of your desired app and click "Save". The new app source should be available at the "Projects" page.

See Video Demonstration, `Here
<https://vimeo.com/418916589>`_.
