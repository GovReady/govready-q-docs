GovReady-Q Documentation
========================

The GovReady-Q Compliance Server is an open source GRC platform for highly automated, user-friendly, self-service compliance assessments and documentation. It's perfect for DevSecOps.

GovReady-Q solves the painful compliance bottleneck of needing months to authorize applications that deploy and redeploy in minutes.

The code is open source, and `available on GitHub
<https://github.com/GovReady/govready-q/>`_.

.. ATTENTION::
   GovReady-Q is in Beta. Suggested for DevSecOps early adopters needing Compliance-as-Code.
